# Audio Files Setup

The WAV files included in this repository are simple sine wave placeholders for testing. 

To use the actual high-quality alarm sounds from freesound.org, please:

1. Download the original files from the sources listed in the README.md:
   - [Wakey by SergeQuadrado](https://freesound.org/people/SergeQuadrado/sounds/460662/)
   - [Alarm Clock Digital by zanox](https://freesound.org/people/zanox/sounds/233645/)
   - [Alarm Clock Beep by SpliceSound](https://freesound.org/people/SpliceSound/sounds/369879/)

2. Replace the placeholder files in the `sounds/` directory with the actual downloads:
   - `460662__sergequadrado__wakey.wav`
   - `233645__zanox__alarm-clock-digital.wav`
   - `369879__splicesound__alarm-clock-beep-distant-perspective.wav`

3. Ensure the filenames match exactly as shown above.

The application will automatically use the new files once they are placed in the sounds directory.
