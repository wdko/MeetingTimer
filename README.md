## Features in Detail

### Timer States
Each timer maintains one of three states:
- **Stopped**: Initial state, can be started
- **Running**: Actively counting down  
- **Paused**: Temporarily stopped, can be resumed

### URL Sharing Format
Timer configurations are encoded in the URL using query parameters:
```
https://wdko.github.io/MeetingTimer/?topic0=Project%20Planning&time0=10&topic1=Code%20Review&time1=15
```

### Local Storage
The application saves these preferences locally:
- Selected alarm sound
- Auto-advance setting
- Theme preference (follows system preference by default)
